1. did not know where to change camera model, was different in video, quick google search 


**Problem:** E (485) camera: Camera probe failed with error 0x105(ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND)
Camera init failed with error 0x105
**Solution:**

### Example Problem
**Problem:** Arduino code will not load on ESP32 Cam.
**Solution:** Camera drivers were incorrect I needed to install the driver: [https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router).  I used file, "CH341SER.ZIP" and it worked.
